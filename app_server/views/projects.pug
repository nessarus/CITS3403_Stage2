doctype html

  style.

  I originally stored the header and navin a seperate file and managed to access them with jQuery. However, Chrome has an issue
  with allowing a webpage access to files on your computer (even if the webpage comes from your computer) rendering my website completely unusuable
  on chrome. As this page explains (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2990518/jquery-load-not-working-in-chrome), it's called the "same origin policy".
  Not having enough time to find an alternate solution, I instead had to copy and paste the code into all webpages. Sorry about the mess
